## Project Overview

This repository contains two Python scripts, PyBank and PyPoll, developed as part of an assignment to analyze financial and election data, respectively. The goal of this project is to leverage Python programming skills to automate the analysis of large datasets and extract meaningful insights for decision-making purposes.

### PyBank:
The PyBank script is designed to analyze a financial dataset (`budget_data.csv`) consisting of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses." The tasks involved in PyBank analysis include calculating:
- The total number of months included in the dataset.
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, along with the average of those changes.
- The greatest increase in profits (including the date and amount) over the entire period.
- The greatest decrease in profits (including the date and amount) over the entire period.

### PyPoll:
The PyPoll script is aimed at analyzing an election dataset (`election_data.csv`) with three columns: "Voter ID," "County," and "Candidate." The tasks involved in PyPoll analysis include determining:
- The total number of votes cast in the election.
- A complete list of candidates who received votes.
- The percentage of votes each candidate won.
- The total number of votes each candidate won.
- The winner of the election based on popular vote.

By completing these tasks, the Python scripts provide comprehensive analyses of financial and election data, showcasing the power of automation and data processing capabilities in Python.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **PyBank:**
  - `main.py`
  - `financial_analysis.txt`
  - **Resources:**
    - `budget_data.csv`: Dataset containing financial records.

- **PyPoll:**
  - `main.py`
  - `election_results.txt`
  - **Resources:**
    - `election_data.csv`: Dataset containing election data.

- **README.md**: This README file provides an overview of the project.

## Tools Used

- **Python:** The primary language used for scripting and data analysis tasks.
- **CSV module:** Imported to read and manipulate CSV files containing data.
- **Spyder IDE:** Used for writing, editing, and debugging Python code.

## Conclusion

I successfully developed two Python scripts, PyBank and PyPoll, to analyze financial and election data, respectively. By implementing Python scripting techniques and utilizing libraries like CSV, I was able to automate the analysis process and extract key insights from the provided datasets.

The PyBank script accurately calculated metrics such as total months, net profit/loss, average change, and identified the greatest increase and decrease in profits over the entire period. On the other hand, the PyPoll script efficiently determined the total number of votes cast, and percentages of votes each candidate won, and declared the election winner based on the popular vote.

Overall, this project showcases my ability to use Python effectively for data analysis tasks, highlighting my programming skills and analytical mindset. It also underscores the importance of automation in handling large datasets, enabling efficient decision-making processes based on data-driven insights.
