This repository contains two Python scripts, PyBank and PyPoll, developed as part of an assignment to analyze financial and election data, respectively. These scripts automate the analysis process and generate key insights from the provided datasets.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **PyBank:**
  - `main.py`
  - `financial_analysis.txt`
  - **Resources:**
    - `budget_data.csv`: Dataset containing financial records.

- **PyPoll:**
  - `main.py`
  - `election_results.txt`
  - **Resources:**
    - `election_data.csv`: Dataset containing election data.

- **README.md**: This README file provides an overview of the project.

## Tools Used

- **Python:** The primary language used for scripting and data analysis tasks.
- **CSV module:** Imported to read and manipulate CSV files containing data.
- **Spyder IDE:** Used for writing, editing, and debugging Python code.

## Conclusion

I successfully developed two Python scripts, PyBank and PyPoll, to analyze financial and election data, respectively. By implementing Python scripting techniques and utilizing libraries like CSV, I was able to automate the analysis process and extract key insights from the provided datasets.

The PyBank script accurately calculated metrics such as total months, net profit/loss, average change, and identified the greatest increase and decrease in profits over the entire period. On the other hand, the PyPoll script efficiently determined the total number of votes cast, and percentages of votes each candidate won, and declared the election winner based on the popular vote.

Overall, this project showcases my ability to use Python effectively for data analysis tasks, highlighting my programming skills and analytical mindset. It also underscores the importance of automation in handling large datasets, enabling efficient decision-making processes based on data-driven insights.
