This repository contains my submission for assignment 3 in the Columbia Data Analytics Bootcamp. We were tasked with developing Python scripts for 2 separate but somewhat similar tasks.

The first script is for PyBank. The script analyses financial data housed in a CSV file which contains Profit & Loss figures over a given timeframe. The script goes through each line and calculates the 
total P&L over the entire period, the average change in P&L over the period, which months saw the greatest increase and greatest decrease, and the corresponding figures. These results are then exported to a 
text (.txt) file.

The second script is for PyPoll. The script analyses election data housed in a CSV file which contains voter ID, county, and the candidate they voted for. The script tallies the total number of votes, votes
obtained by each candidate, and the corresponding percentage of the total vote, and returns the election winner based on these results. These results are then exported to a text (.txt) file.
